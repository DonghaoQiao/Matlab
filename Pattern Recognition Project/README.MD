This project is to recognize images for dogs and cats by using Matlab.  
Just run main.m.  
main.m	    main.m is to reduce the dimension of the images and it will show the results.  
wavelet.m   This is a function to preprocess the figures and obtain edges of the images.  
lda.m	    This is a function to implement Linear Discriminent Analysis.  
knn.m	    This is a function to implement K-Nearest Neighbor.  
svm.m	    This is a function to implement Support Vector Machine.  
edge.m	    This is to plot the edge images of two examples.
